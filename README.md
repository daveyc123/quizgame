# Quizgame

## Overview

Quizgame is Raspberry-Pi based application that presents several two-answer questions to the player. The time in which they complete the questions is their resulting score. A time penalty is applied for any questions that they answer incorrectly.

I designed this game to raise money at my brother-in-law's stag. The game presented questions in which the answer was either him or my soon to be sister-in-law.
